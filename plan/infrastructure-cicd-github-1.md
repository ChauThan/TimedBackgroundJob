# Introduction

![Status: Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-brightgreen)
This implementation plan establishes a CI/CD pipeline for the TimedBackgroundJob repository using GitHub Actions, with automated build, test, and deployment processes for all code changes. NuGet package publishing is restricted to GitHub Packages only.

This implementation plan establishes a CI/CD pipeline for the TimedBackgroundJob repository using GitHub Actions. The goal is to automate build, test, and deployment processes for all code changes, ensuring reliability and rapid feedback for contributors.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Automate build, test, and deployment for all pushes and pull requests to `main` and feature branches.
- **REQ-002**: Use GitHub Actions for workflow orchestration.
- **REQ-003**: Support .NET 9.0 SDK or later.
- **REQ-004**: Run tests in `tests/TimedBackgroundJob.Tests/` and fail workflow on test errors.
- **REQ-005**: Publish NuGet package on release (tagged commit) to GitHub Packages only.
- **SEC-001**: Use GitHub-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication to GitHub Packages.
- **CON-001**: Workflows must be idempotent and not require manual intervention.
- **GUD-001**: Follow best practices for .NET CI/CD and GitHub Actions.
- **PAT-001**: Use matrix builds for Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS runners.

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Implementation Phase 1

- GOAL-001: Establish CI workflow for build and test automation

## Status Update

As of 2025-08-05:
- CI workflow is fully implemented and operational for all pushes and PRs to `main` and feature branches.
- Matrix builds for Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS are configured and passing.
- All build, restore, and test steps are automated using .NET 9.0 SDK.
- Test failures correctly fail the workflow; test results are uploaded as artifacts.
- CD workflow for NuGet package publishing is created and triggers on tagged commits.
- Publish steps for GitHub Packages are in place (using `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
- Notification steps for deployment success/failure are implemented.

All tasks are complete. The pipeline is ready for use and publishes only to GitHub Packages.


## 3. Alternatives

**ALT-001**: Use Azure DevOps Pipelines. Not chosen due to native GitHub integration and simplicity of GitHub Actions.
**ALT-002**: Use manual deployment scripts. Not chosen due to lack of automation and reliability.
**ALT-003**: Publish to NuGet.org. Not chosen due to scope restriction to GitHub Packages only.

## 4. Dependencies

**DEP-001**: .NET 9.0 SDK available on GitHub Actions runners.
**DEP-002**: GitHub-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication to GitHub Packages.

## 5. Files

- **FILE-001**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI workflow for build/test.
- **FILE-002**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` — CD workflow for package publishing.
- **FILE-003**: `README.md` — Update with CI/CD status badges and instructions.
- **FILE-004**: `src/TimedBackgroundJob/TimedBackgroundJob.csproj` — Ensure correct package metadata for publishing.

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-001**: Validate CI workflow triggers on push/PR and fails on test errors.
- **TEST-002**: Validate CD workflow triggers on tagged commits and publishes package.
- **TEST-003**: Verify matrix builds succeed on all platforms.
- **TEST-004**: Confirm test results are uploaded as workflow artifacts.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Incorrect secrets configuration may block package publishing.
- **RISK-002**: Workflow failures due to runner environment inconsistencies.
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: All contributors have access to required secrets for publishing.
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: .NET 9.0 SDK is available and compatible with all runners.
