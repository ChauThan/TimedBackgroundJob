# Introduction

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This implementation plan establishes a CI/CD pipeline for the TimedBackgroundJob repository using GitHub Actions. The goal is to automate build, test, and deployment processes for all code changes, ensuring reliability and rapid feedback for contributors.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Automate build, test, and deployment for all pushes and pull requests to `main` and feature branches.
- **REQ-002**: Use GitHub Actions for workflow orchestration.
- **REQ-003**: Support .NET 9.0 SDK or later.
- **REQ-004**: Run tests in `tests/TimedBackgroundJob.Tests/` and fail workflow on test errors.
- **REQ-005**: Publish NuGet package on release (tagged commit) to GitHub Packages.
- **SEC-001**: Secure secrets (NuGet API keys, etc.) using GitHub repository secrets.
- **CON-001**: Workflows must be idempotent and not require manual intervention.
- **GUD-001**: Follow best practices for .NET CI/CD and GitHub Actions.
- **PAT-001**: Use matrix builds for Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS runners.

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Implementation Phase 1

- GOAL-001: Establish CI workflow for build and test automation

| Task      | Description                                                                                  | Completed | Date       |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
| TASK-001  | Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for build/test on push and PR to `main` and feature branches |           |            |
| TASK-002  | Configure matrix build for Windows, Ubuntu, macOS                                            |           |            |
| TASK-003  | Add steps to restore, build, and test solution using .NET 9.0 SDK                            |           |            |
| TASK-004  | Fail workflow on test errors; upload test results as artifacts                                |           |            |

### Implementation Phase 2

- GOAL-002: Establish CD workflow for NuGet package publishing on release

| Task      | Description                                                                                  | Completed | Date       |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|
| TASK-005  | Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` for publishing NuGet package on tagged commits         |           |            |
| TASK-006  | Configure workflow to use GitHub secrets for NuGet API key                                   |           |            |
| TASK-007  | Add step to publish package to GitHub Packages and/or NuGet.org                              |           |            |
| TASK-008  | Add notification step for successful/failed deployments                                      |           |            |

## Status Update

As of 2025-08-05:
- CI workflow is fully implemented and operational for all pushes and PRs to `main` and feature branches.
- Matrix builds for Windows, Ubuntu, and macOS are configured and passing.
- All build, restore, and test steps are automated using .NET 9.0 SDK.
- Test failures correctly fail the workflow; test results are uploaded as artifacts.
- CD workflow for NuGet package publishing is created and triggers on tagged commits.
- Publish steps for GitHub Packages and NuGet.org are in place.
- Notification steps for deployment success/failure are implemented.
- **Pending:** GitHub/NuGet secrets configuration for publishing (TASK-006).

All other tasks are complete. The pipeline is ready for use except for secret configuration, which must be completed before publishing to NuGet.org.


## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Use Azure DevOps Pipelines. Not chosen due to native GitHub integration and simplicity of GitHub Actions.
- **ALT-002**: Use manual deployment scripts. Not chosen due to lack of automation and reliability.

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: .NET 9.0 SDK available on GitHub Actions runners.
- **DEP-002**: GitHub repository secrets for NuGet API key.
- **DEP-003**: Access to GitHub Packages and/or NuGet.org for publishing.

## 5. Files

- **FILE-001**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI workflow for build/test.
- **FILE-002**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` — CD workflow for package publishing.
- **FILE-003**: `README.md` — Update with CI/CD status badges and instructions.
- **FILE-004**: `src/TimedBackgroundJob/TimedBackgroundJob.csproj` — Ensure correct package metadata for publishing.

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-001**: Validate CI workflow triggers on push/PR and fails on test errors.
- **TEST-002**: Validate CD workflow triggers on tagged commits and publishes package.
- **TEST-003**: Verify matrix builds succeed on all platforms.
- **TEST-004**: Confirm test results are uploaded as workflow artifacts.

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Incorrect secrets configuration may block package publishing.
- **RISK-002**: Workflow failures due to runner environment inconsistencies.
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: All contributors have access to required secrets for publishing.
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: .NET 9.0 SDK is available and compatible with all runners.
